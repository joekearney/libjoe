This started life as a dumping ground for various bits, including some moderately interesting collection implementations.

The **Bootstrapper** is the most useful bit. See the [introduction document here](https://github.com/joekearney/libjoe/blob/master/libjoe-bootstrapper/doc/bootstrapper-intro.pdf?raw=true). It's a way of managing configuration for an app that can have multiple environments, run on multiple hosts or OSs, etc. It's been used in anger basically since inception, so it's proven to work.
