This started life as a dumping ground for various bits, including some moderately interesting collection implementations.

The **Bootstrapper** is the most useful bit. See the [introduction document here](https://github.com/joekearney/libjoe/blob/master/libjoe-bootstrapper/doc/bootstrapper-intro.pdf?raw=true). It's a way of managing configuration for an app that can have multiple environments, run on multiple hosts or OSs, etc.
